MY TAMAGOCHI GAME REPORT

I've created an game similar to the Tamagochi game. This game  allows he player to take care of a pet (I chose a white Golden retriever for my game). The game has two activities; one that displays the welcome page and one that displays the gameplay page.
The first activity has a joyful image of the Golden retriever, a warm welcome message as well as a button that will redirect the player to the second activity where they are going to proceed with the gameplay.

The second activitiy includes a lot of views; an image view that will diplay te same oicture of the golden retriever from the first activity, three progress bars that will change colours and levels based on the statuses of the dog's hunger, hapinness and hygiene.
It also has three buttons that will allow the player to bath, feed and play with the dog. The intresting part is that the buttons' functions do not end there, they also allow the user to starve, upset and make the dog muddy. I chose thet word 'dirty' for my make muddy button because seems to be the sshortest word i can use to avoid messing with the size of my button.
The second activity works with 7 different images, namely, the dog bathing image, the dog playing image, the dog eating image, the dog sad image, the dog hungry image, the dog muddy image as well as the default image shi=owing the dog joyful.

I put a text view that displays the results of any action taken' for example, when the player clicks the feed button, the text view will display a message written "Thank you for feeding me, I ma full." 
I used a cute pastel colour palette for my game.
I had a lot of issues creating this Tamagochi App. The constraints are not working no matter what i do. Evrything is working perfectly fine but this one issue affects almost 90% of the game. Without working constraints, my game is not user friendly and the buttons that have to be clicked are not even visible, meaning the player will not the able to interact with the game. I tried usng the infer constraints feature, I tried searching online, I tried watching constraints videos  but still nothing seems to be working. This is worrying me because i want to submit my app. It is ready!

Below are pictures of how my game looks within android studio

I had no issue pushing my app to gitHub, it was one of the easiest tasks.
